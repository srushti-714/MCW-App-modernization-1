## Exercise 1: Setting up Azure Migrate

Duration: 10 minutes

Azure Migrate provides a centralized hub to assess and migrate on-premises servers, infrastructure, applications, and data to Azure . It provides a single portal to start, run, and track your migration to Azure. Azure Migrate comes with a range of tools for assessment and migration that we will use during our lab. We will use Azure Migrate as the central location for our assessment and migration efforts.

1. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), navigate to your lab resource group. Select **Add** to add a new resource.
