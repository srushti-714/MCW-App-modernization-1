# App modernization hands-on lab step-by-step

## Abstract and learning objectives

In this hands-on lab, you implement the steps to modernize a legacy on-premises application, including upgrading and migrating the application and the database to Azure and updating the application to take advantage of serverless and cloud services.

At the end of this hands-on lab, your ability to build solutions for modernizing legacy on-premises applications and infrastructure using cloud services will be improved.

## Overview

Parts Unlimited is an online auto parts store. Founded in Spokane, WA, in 2008, they are providing both genuine OEM and aftermarket parts for cars, sport utility vehicles, vans, and trucks, including new and remanufactured complex parts, maintenance items, and accessories. Their mission is to make buying vehicle replacement parts easy for consumers and professionals. Parts Unlimited has 185 stores in the US, with plans to scale to Mexico and Brazil.

Parts Unlimited has a hosted web application on its internal infrastructure and using a Windows Server, Internet Information Services (IIS), and Microsoft SQL Server to host the solution. Beyond the initial effort and costs, these applications incur ongoing maintenance costs in hardware, operating system updates, and licensing fees. These maintenance costs make Microsoft Azure App Service an attractive alternative. Their team is looking to migrate Microsoft ASP.NET applications and any SQL Server database to Azure App Service and Azure SQL Database. However, they are worried that their application might not be supported. Their web site is built on a .NET Core version that hit the end of life on December 23, 2019. They wonder if they can move to the cloud now and migrate their application later or if the old version will be a show stopper.

Additionally, Parts Unlimited has plans to increase its marketing investment, currently on hold because of scaling issues. The company is stuck and can't grow without increasing its infrastructure footprint. Their CEO wants to finalize their cloud vs. on-premises decision based on the current migration effort's success. The engineering team is worried about their order processing subsystem. Currently, they have a strongly coupled order processing system that runs synchronously during checkout. When moved to the cloud, they don't want to be worried about their order processing system's scalability. They are looking for a modern approach with the least migration effort possible.

Finally, Parts Unlimited is looking to invest in DevOps practices to decrease human error in deployments. They are looking for options to have a staging environment to test functionality before shipping to production. However, their team does not have any experience in building CI/CD pipelines. They are not sure if this goal is achievable in the short term, and they do not want it to hold up their migration to the cloud.

## Solution architecture

Below is a high-level architecture diagram of the solution you implement in this hands-on lab. Please review this carefully, so you understand the whole of the solution as you are working on the various components.

![This solution diagram includes a high-level overview of the architecture implemented within this hands-on lab.](media/architecture-diagram.png "Solution architecture diagram")

> **Note:** The solution provided is only one of many possible, viable approaches.

The solution begins with setting up Azure Migrate as the central assessment and migration hub for Parts Unlimited's E-Commerce web site. Using the App Service Migration Assistant tool from Azure Migrate, Parts Unlimited found that their web site is fully compatible with Azure App Service. As a next step, they use App Service Migration Assistant to provision an Azure App Service environment and deploy their application to Azure. Following the success in moving the web application, Parts Unlimited uses the Data Migration Assistant (DMA) assessment to determine that they can migrate into a fully-managed SQL Database service in Azure. The assessment reveals no compatibility issues or unsupported features that would prevent them from using Azure SQL Database.

Next, Parts Unlimited sets up a private GitHub repository and pushes their codebase to GitHub. They set up deployment slots to have a staging environment to test functionality before releasing to production. As a CI/CD solution, they decide to use GitHub Actions and Workflows.

Finally, Parts Unlimited decides to decouple its order processing system and move to an event-driven serverless compute platform. Following a [web-queue-worker architecture](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/guide/architecture-styles/web-queue-worker), they build an Azure Function and use Azure Storage Queue to process orders and create invoices asynchronously. When new orders come in, the web front end adds jobs into the queue consumed by Azure Functions. The Functions App scales independently based on the number of jobs in the queue, helping Parts Unlimited elastically handle a variable amount of orders.
